## Running Solutions

Pass a day, a part, and an optional data file suffix to run.

Day is a two-digit integer between 01 and 25.

Part is `a` or `b`.

The data file path will be `data/XY.txt`, where `XY` is the day.
If you include a suffix like `ex`, it will be appended after an underscore, such as `01_ex.txt`.

Examples:

`cargo run -- 01 a ex` will run the day 01 part a code on `data/01_ex.txt`

`cargo run -- 01 b` will run the day 01 part b code on `data/01.txt`
